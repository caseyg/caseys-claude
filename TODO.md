## notion-todoist

Create Todoist tasks from Notion meeting notes.

- Parse meeting notes for action items (look for checkboxes, "TODO", assignee mentions)
- Extract due dates from meeting context
- Link back to source Notion page in task description
- Handle recurring meetings (don't duplicate existing tasks)
